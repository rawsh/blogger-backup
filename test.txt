<p>My poem</p><p>When I get up in the morning</p><p>Basking in sunlight warming</p><p>I go down the stairs</p><p>Two at a time</p><p>And I see somebody snoring</p><p>This somebody shouldn't be sleeping</p><p>For soon he will be weeping</p><p>Because when you stay up all night</p><p>Playing minecraft until the dawns light</p><p>Being grounded is rather boring</p>
