<br />
<br />
These are just some of the questions people ask Google about homelessness in San Francisco, according to
<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_t62vdFUBAABNWM_en">
 Google Trends
</a>
. Many of these questions dont have simple answers, and
<a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/letters-from-the-mayors/">
 decades of efforts
</a>
have not significantly moved the needle. There are more than 6,600 homeless people in the city, many of whom are children. People who experience homelessness often struggle from chronic stress, trauma, and frequent moves, and are unable to take advantage of many educational or economic opportunities.
<br />
<br />
We want to do our part in tackling this complex issue. Since 2014, Google.org has invested more than $5 million in Bay Area nonprofits who are working to combat homelessness, and today were committing an additional $1.2 million for these efforts. The Google News Lab is also
<a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/">
 joining the San Francisco Chronicle and 70+ news outlets
</a>
across the country to help raise awareness as part of the Beyond Homelessness initiative, launching today.
<br />
<br />
The organizations were supporting are tackling the issue of homelessness in new ways and from multiple angles, and include

One in 25 kids in San Francisco Unified School District are homeless, and many families face at least a nine-month wait list for temporary shelter. In 2015, we supported the
<a href="https://hamiltonfamilycenter.org/">
 Hamilton Family Center
</a>
(HFC) with a $1 million grant aimed to reduce the homeless family wait list for shelter by creating direct lines of communication with SFUSD teachers and staff to report and respond to new and potential cases of homelessness.  HFC has already seen a 25 percent reduction in the family wait list, and hopes to continue that momentum.
