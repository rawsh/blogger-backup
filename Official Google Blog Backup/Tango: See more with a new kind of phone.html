But it cant answer basic (and important) questions like, Wheres the nearest building exit? or Will this couch actually fit in my apartment? Thats because while your phone may know where you are in the world, it doesnt know where you are in the room.

<br />
But, for the past three years, the Project Tango team has been working to help devices understand physical space and motion more like people do. Today were taking the next step with the first Tango-enabled phone (Lenovos

). Were also graduating the effort from Project Tango to, simply, Tango.

Tango helps you answer a new set of questions about your world through specialized hardware and apps. Some of the coolest apps that work with Tango are the ones that overlay digital objects on top of your surroundings. For example if youre shopping for a new bed, Tango lets you view your bedroom through your phone and visualize different optionseven walk around the virtual furniture like its actually there.

With a Tango-enabled phone, you also have a toy box, a solar system, and a pet shop in your pocket.  You can play with a huge set of dominoes, explore the planets, defend yourself from invading aliens, or feed your virtual dogall through your phone. The best part is that you dont have to clean up afterwards.

In the future, we hope Tango can help you navigate a mall, museum or place youve never been. Tango can overlay directions to your destination, then provide more info once you arrive. We've already started to work on thiswe previewed it in February with the

, and we plan to bring select locations online later this year.

Whether youre shopping, playing, or just finding your way around, Tango helps you explore the world in a new way. There are already lots of
