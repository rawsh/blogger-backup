, a partnership among nonprofits to give the children of incarcerated parents a chance to have their voices heard. Today, in celebration of Fathers Day, you can watch Love Letters for incarcerated fathers. This work is part of our continued commitment to

 bearing witness

to the human costs of mass incarceration.
<br />
<br />
The costs of mass incarceration have disproportionately affected the lives of Black men. From 1980 to 2007, about

 one in three
</a>
of the 25.4 million adults arrested for drugs was African-American. And if that current trend continues, one in three Black boys born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. All in all, were now at a point where there are

 Children share digital Love Letters for their fathers who are incarcerated
</i>
<br />
<br />
Many of these men are also fathersand their children have suffered greatly. The loss of a father to incarceration

 adversely
</a>
affects childrens educational, social and emotional well-being, even decades later.
<a href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2014/incarcerated-parents-and-childrens-health.aspx">
 Children with an incarcerated parent
</a>
are three times more likely to have behavioral problems or depression, and at least twice as likely to suffer from learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, and anxiety.
<br />
<br />
This is what Love Letters conveys: the hurt of the children left behindand the enduring bond between a child and a parent despite the barrier of prison walls. So for Father's Day, we worked with the NGOs
<a href="http://popstheclub.com/">
 Pops the Club
</a>
and
<a href="http://www.theplace4grace.org/">
 Place4Grace
</a>
to encourage children and youth in California to share their love letters to their fathers behind bars. We're also working with the California Department of Corrections to share the video with fathers behind bars throughout the state.

. As David Drummond, Alphabets vice president of corporate development, said at an event this week: We like disruption, and if theres a system worth disrupting, its the criminal justice system. We hope that by raising awareness about the impact of mass incarceration on children and families, we can help to change it. Please join us in this effortwatch the video and share with #LoveLetters on social media.
