 Mapping the whole city
</b>
<br />
A huge part of Rios history and culture resides in the hillside favelas that dot the landscape. In fact, one in five Rio residents live in favelas, but only 0.001 percent of the city's favelas appear on the map. That means 1.4 million people have no addresses to list on job applications or bank accounts, and arent able to access many economic opportunities, essential services, even basic rights as citizens. So we teamed up with local NGO Grupo Cultural AfroReggae to map the favelas. Two years later, streets and 10,000+ local businesses in 26 favelas now appear on Google Maps, thanks to "

 Beyond the Map

<br />
Along the way, we met some amazing people with remarkable stories, so we decided it was time to go "
<a href="http://g.co/beyondthemap">
 Beyond the Map
</a>
" and shine a spotlight on an often overlooked side of Rio. With AfroReggae's help, we brought Street View and 360 technology to favelas for the first time, creating an immersive experience that lets you go beyond GPS coordinates and get to know the people and culture of communities that many people otherwise wouldn't get the chance to visit. You can even experience what it feels like to zip through the narrow streets of a favela on a motorcycle taxi!
