 Google Cast for Education

<br />

 Quizzes in Google Forms
</b>
<br />
Getting feedback helps students learn and teachers teach. But grading tests and quizzes is time-consuming; teachers often have to take time away from other tasks to do it, and if its not done promptly, everyone misses out on the opportunity to learn from the things students got wrong. Starting today,
<a href="https://goo.gl/ZfwK68">
 Quizzes in Google Forms
</a>
will grade multiple choice and checkbox questions automaticallyso teachers can spend less time grading work and more time teaching.
<br />
<br />
Teachers can set correct answers in Forms and even add review materials in the form of explanations, supplemental websites, or review videosso students can get quick, informative feedback on how to improve. Plus, teachers can get an instant snapshot on what their students understand, so they know which lessons need more explanation or what to teach next.
