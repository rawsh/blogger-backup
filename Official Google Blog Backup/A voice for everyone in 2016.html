              </style>Every election matters and every vote counts. The American democracy relies on everyones participation in the political process. This November, Americans all across the country will line up at the polls to cast their ballots for the President of the United States. With states varied deadlines and methods, the voter registration process can be tricky. So starting on Monday, we're introducing a new tool in Search to simplify the voter registration process to make it easier for you to have your voice heard.
<br />
<br />
Now when you search for register to vote or similar queries, Google will display a detailed state-by-state guide providing information on how to register, general requirements, and deadlines.

<br />
No matter which state youre in or how you plan to cast your ballot, you can find the step-by-step information you need to register correctly and on timeright at the top of your Search page and in the Google app.
<br />
<br />
And for the kickoff of the

 Republican National Convention
</a>
next week (and coming in time for the Democratic National Convention the following week), when you search for these events on the Google app, youll find a summary of the event, nominees and the lineup of speakers. Youll also find a livestream video from YouTube, and relevant social media posts, so you can stay up-to-date with both the political parties and the public.
<br />
<br />
We hope these new features in Search will help keep you informed this election season and make it easier for you to make it to the ballot box in November.
