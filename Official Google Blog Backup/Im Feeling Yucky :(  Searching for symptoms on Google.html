                }
              </style>Picture this: you woke up today with a headache. Its been getting worse all day, and you arent sure if you should be worried or not. So you open
<a href="http://g.co/googleapp">
 the Google app
</a>
and start searching for your symptoms. After 20 minutes digging through health forums, chances are you're overwhelmed by all the complicated medical terms and breaking out in a sweatwhether thats related to the headache or the overdose of info is unclear!
<br />
<br />
Youre not alone. Roughly 1 percent of searches on Google (think:
<i>
 millions!
</i>
) are symptom-related. But health content on the web can be difficult to navigate, and tends to lead people from mild symptoms to scary and unlikely conditions, which can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.
<br />
<br />
So starting in the coming days, when you ask Google about symptoms like
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache+on+one+side">
 headache on one side
</a>
, well show you a list of related conditions (headache, migraine, tension headache, cluster headache, sinusitis, and common cold). For individual symptoms like
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache">
 headache
</a>
, well also give you an overview description along with information on self-treatment options and what might warrant a doctors visit. By doing this, our goal is to help you to navigate and explore health conditions related to your symptoms, and quickly get to the point where you can do more in-depth research on the web or talk to a health professional.
<br />
<br />
We create the list of symptoms by looking for health conditions mentioned in web results, and then checking them against high-quality medical information weve collected from doctors for our
<a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">
 Knowledge Graph
</a>
. We worked with a team of medical doctors to carefully review the individual symptom information, and experts at Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic evaluated related conditions for a representative sample of searches to help improve the lists we show.

<br />
That said, symptom search (like all medical information on Google) is intended for informational purposes only, and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice. We rely on search results, and we reflect whats on the web. Because of this, your feedback is especially important to us; well use it to keep improving the results we show. Youll notice in the weeks following launch that when we show symptom search well automatically ask you if the results are helpful.
<br />
<br />
Were rolling this update out on mobile over the next few days, in English in the U.S. to start. Over time, we hope to cover more symptoms, and we also want to extend this to other languages and internationally. So the next time youre worried about your

 child with knee pain
</a>
(even though its probably just growing pains), or have some symptoms youre too embarrassed to run by your roommate, a Google search will be a helpful place to start.
