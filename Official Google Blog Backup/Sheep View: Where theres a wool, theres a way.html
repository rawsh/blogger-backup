The 18 Faroe Islands are home to just 50,000 people, but  fittingly for a country whose name means Sheep Island  there are 70,000 sheep roaming the green hills and volcanic cliffs of the archipelago. So when Durita decided to document the country for Street View, sheep werent a baaad place to start.

Now that the Faroe Islands is supplied with a Trekker and 360 cameras, residents and tourists can assist the sheep in collecting Street View imagery of their beautiful lands using selfie-sticks, bikes, backpacks, cars, kayaks, horses, ships and even wheelbarrows. The Visit Faroe Islands office in Trshavn and Atlantic Airways at the airport will be lending out Street View 360 cameras to visitors willing to lend a hoof.
