              </style>Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldnt have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. Its no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*.

Today, were releasing
<a href="http://duo.google.com/">
 Google Duo
</a>
a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.

 Google Duo works across Android and iOS  all you need is a phone number
</i>
<br />
<b>
 <br />
 Simple interface
</b>
<br />
Duo is simple from start to finish. To get started, all you need is your phone number and youll be able to reach people in your phones contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap.
<br />
<br />
<b>
 Fast and reliable
</b>
<br />
We all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy. Weve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected  when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door.
<br />
<br />
<b>
 Human design
</b>
<br />
We designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person youre calling. To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIeMysX76pM">
 Knock Knock
</a>
which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what theyre up to and why they want to chat. Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up.
<br />

 Knock Knock in Duo lets you see whos calling before you pick up
</i>
<br />
<br />
Finally, we built Duo with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted.
<br />
<br />
Give your friends a wave with Duo! Were beginning to roll out Duo for
