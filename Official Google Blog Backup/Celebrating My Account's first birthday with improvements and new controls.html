 A helping hand when you lose your phone
</b>
<br />
We entrust our phones with some of our most personal data: texts from loved ones, family photos, work emails, bank account information, and more. In the wrong hands, that data could cause trouble. Unfortunately,
<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/06/smartphone-thefts-on-the-decline/index.htm">
 millions of phones
</a>
are stolen every year in the U.S. alone, and countless more are lost in taxis, cafes, and couch cushions around the world. But when your phone goes missing, its not always easy to figure out where to start, who to call, or how to keep your information safe.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://myaccount.google.com/find-your-phone?utm_source=ogb-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-pr&amp;utm_campaign=anniversary">
 Find your phone
</a>
is a new feature that will help you if your phone is ever lost or stolen. In a few simple steps, you can not only locate your phone, but also lock and call it, secure your account, leave a callback number on the screen, and more. The feature can be used to find lost Android and iOS devices, and soon, youll also be able to access it by searching Google for I lost my phone.

So, were making it easier to get to My Account just by using your voice. In the latest Google app you can simply say, Ok Google, show me my Google account, and well take you right there. This is available today in English, with other languages coming soon.
