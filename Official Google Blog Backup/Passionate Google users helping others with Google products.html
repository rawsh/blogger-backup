The super users in the Top Contributor program come from 60+ different countries. Their passion for our products and willingness to help others make them a community. To showcase the faces and stories behind this group of helpful users, we asked a few Top Contributors to share a bit about themselves. This is the first of two postscome back tomorrow to learn more.

As a writer, editor, and all-around book enthusiast, I spend a lot of time using word-processing programs. I first discovered Google Docs when I saw a Chromebook ad on TV. I was intrigued by the idea of working in the cloud and not needing an external hard drive to backup my work.
<br />
<br />
I use Docs for both my professional and personal writing and have completed works of nonfiction as well as novels in it. As senior editorial director at
<a href="https://www.bookpubco.com/">
 Book Publishing Co.
</a>
, I use Docs for reviewing and editing manuscripts, writing copy, and communicating with authors and colleagues. My authors and colleagues are fascinated when we're in a document at the same time and they see me making changes. It looks like magic to them!
<br />
<br />
Helping others navigate Docs might seem like an unusual hobby, but I love it. I like exercising my brain by exploring all that an app can do. Its rewarding to answer users questions and help them solve conundrums, especially knowing that my reply could potentially reach hundreds or even thousands of others users who visit the forum with a similar issue. The occasional thank you or you saved the day is icing on the cake.

I grew up in a small town in the central region of Ghana, the oldest of five childrenwhich meant I learned how to work hard. Being the oldest meant I had to set a positive example for my siblings and cousins. I graduated with a bachelors degree in chemistry with honors from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, where Im now a teaching and research assistant.
<br />
<br />
I first got involved with Google products as a
<a href="https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/student-ambassador-program/">
 Google Student Ambassador
</a>
, a program that gives students the opportunity to be a liaison between their university and Google. During that time, I gave tutorials to anyone from first year students to senior faculty in my department, teaching them how to incorporate Google apps like Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides into their day-to-day.
<br />
<br />
When I became a teaching and research assistant, I started using Google Forms to create short quizzes and Google Groups to send assignments and notes to the students in my lab experiment groups. Those experiences inspired me to start helping out in the forums, where I specialize in Nexus and Photosproducts I dont often get to use in the classroom.
<br />
<br />
I love troubleshooting issues with products because it challenges me to pinpoint issues given very little information. It not only teaches me to solve problems, but it also shows me how I can interrelate things when teaching in order to help students. My experience there inspires me to take on more challenges elsewhere. Next up: grad school.
