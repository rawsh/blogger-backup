              </style>Friday night is movie night at our home, and my wife and I look forward to our weekly ritual of putting the kids to bed, getting some takeout, and catching up on our movie wishlist. Whether its making the BLUE STEEL face from
<i>
 Zoolander
</i>
, swapping tips on playing
<i>
 Monument Valley
</i>
, or reading
<i>
 Dragons Love Tacos
</i>
to the kids at bedtime, these shared moments bring us closer together.
<br />
<br />
For families like mine, who bond over shared entertainment, were introducing
<a href="http://g.co/FamilyLibrary">
 Family Library
</a>
, a way for up to six family members to share purchases on
<a href="http://play.google.com">
 Google Play
</a>
. When you buy an eligible app, game, movie, TV show, or book in the Play Store, you can now share it with your familyacross deviceswith no additional sign-up fee.

<b>
 Share across your familys devices
</b>
<br />
Todays families have a lot of devices, and it should be easy to share content no matter where we are or what were doing. Everyone in my family loves the
<i>
 Star Wars
</i>
movies and we all want to be able to watch them, on our phones, tablets, laptops, or TV.  All purchases added to Family Library are available across Android devices, and movies, TV shows, and books can be enjoyed on iOS devices and the web.
<br />
<br />
<b>
 Easily manage sharing and family purchases
</b>
<br />
As with most family matters, flexibility and choice is important. With Family Library, you can choose which items you want to share and which to keep to yourselffor example, Ill probably keep my collection of comic books in my personal library. Flexibility is also built into your purchasing options. When you sign up, youll select a credit card to share as your family payment method, but your family members will always have the option of buying stuff with their personal credit cards or gift cards. And for your younger family members, youll have the option to approve each of their purchases.
<br />
<br />
<b>
 Share a Music subscription with your family
</b>
<br />
Finally, if your family loves music, you can also subscribe to the
<a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?signup=1&amp;coupon=FAMILYSTANDARD&amp;coupontype=VANITY">
 Google Play Music family plan
</a>
. On this plan, up to six family members can stream millions of songs on demand for $14.99 a month. We
<a href="https://android.googleblog.com/2015/12/google-play-music-now-playing-for-your.html">
 launched
</a>
the family plan late last year, and today were expanding it to Ireland, Italy, Mexico, and New Zealand. And you can now sign up on the web, in addition to your Android device.
<br />
<br />
