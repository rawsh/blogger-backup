What an awesome place. We stayed at the Tenaya lodge outside the valley, skied two days at Badger Pass, and spent the last day exploring the valley including a short hike to Vernal Falls.
<br />
<br />
Katerina had another lesson, and can now ski without the bungee cord at the front of the skis. She still needs a hand when the slopes get steeper, but is becoming pretty confident. Instead of spending part of the day in the lodge with Larissa, she is able to ski the whole day long. This means now Larissa is on the slopes with the rest of us!

We had a really nice trip, and unfortunately I dont think we will make it back before the move to Australia this year. Now that I have been there once, I cant believe I have not seen more of the valley and the backcountry.
