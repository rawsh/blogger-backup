              </style>We got the bug for a little backpacking in November and decided to go to Pt Reyes. Pt Reyes is not backcountry camping because there are pit toilets and potable water, but the destination is beautiful and I admit it is pretty nice not to have to dig a hole to go to the bathroom.
<br />
<br />
We spent two nights, one just off the water in Wildcat Camp, and one up on the ridge in Sky Camp. We parked at the Bear Valley Visitor Center (park headquarters), and had a 7 mile day down to Wildcat Camp on the coast, an 8 mile day past Arch Rock and back up to Sky Camp, and finally a 4 mile route over Mt Whittenburg and back out to the trailhead.
<br />
<br />
We had absolutely perfect weather, so nice that I plan to return every November that I can, and may even try January.

 On the ridge above Wildcat Camp. Ridiculously peaceful ocean in the background. Our campsite was near the water right by the cut to the left of Robert.

 Happy hikers. Ridiculously calm ocean in the background. I still cant believe how little wind there was.

 Alemere Falls is the white spot up the coast. We intended to make it there but decided we had enough hiking for the day and returned to camp.

 More of the beautiful Coast Trail. I will note that parts of this trail appear to be an erosian channel: very narrow and not much fun to hike on, but overall we enjoyed the trails.
