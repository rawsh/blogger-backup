              </style>A short hike with my parents up an old favorite mountain in the Adirondacks.   This was a spur of the moment decision, after lunch, to go hit poko. The boys and I and Mom and Dad went. There is a new trail since I used to hike the mountain that was advertised as less steep.

The boys and I went ahead a little bit and Robert almost immediately got into trouble just past this bridge. He decided to leap into the mud and his shoe came off in the suction.

As a young boy I slept on this ridge with nothing but a sleeping bag. Now that I am older I find I need an expensive sleeping mat in order to enjoy a night in the backcountry.
