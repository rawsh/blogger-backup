              </style>We did not get a lot of good pictures on this trip because some obscure setting was enabled on the real camera, and we didn't notice until way too late. In the "old days" we used to download the photos every night, or else we wouldn't have room to save the next day's batch. Our new camera can shoot for a week without needing to save the pictures, so we did not catch the problem in time.

 In any case, this was Katerina's first year on skiis, so for that reason alone it was quite cool. We went to "Homewood", a small resort on the west side of the lake that is relatively unknown, at least compared to the monster resorts of the south lake. We really enjoyed the mountain and again shared the cabin with our friends who have kids of similar ages.

 Last year they laughed at me when I tried to get skis for Katerina, but this year I was able to pull it off. I must have been much younger when I was getting Robert and Erick up for the first few times, because I dont recall it being so much hard work. Katerina had a blast and kept saying "more" ... "more" ...

 The last day was a little blustery, so we stopped at the Lodge and had hot chocolate. Robert and Erick and I enjoyed a full day of skiing together.

 On the way out of town we stopped at the beach for this photo. Man I really do wish I had a little cabin at Tahoe ...
