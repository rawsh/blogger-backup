   Lots of snakes

</h2>
The boys and I went to Black Diamond Mines regional park for a quick one day backpacking trip in May. It was gorgeous weather and we had a really nice time exploring a brand new place.
<br />
<br />
<h3>
 Sunday morning drop off in Clayton
</h3>
<br />
Larissa dropped us off in Clayton, on the map about about 6 miles from the park visitor center. Katerina and Larissa walked with us for a little way.

 <br />
 <br />
 <h3>
  200 yards later: snake number 1
 </h3>
 <br />
 A few minutes after the girls turned around we ran into snake number 1. We had already had several discussions about snakes, as I was aware they were out this time of year. This one looked scary from a distance but was harmless and slithered off with very little prompting.
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />
 So we continued up the trail. The temperature was perfect, there was a breeze in our faces, the sun was shining. The grass was waving from the breeze. There were abundant flowers. It was, in fact, a perfect day for a hike.
 <br />
 <br />

  We were very cautious because we thought snake number 2 could be hiding in the grass on the trail

  200 yards later: snake number 2
 </h3>
 <br />
 So this one was a rattler. I saw it 30 feet away and didnt go much closer than that. I threw some small stones and dirt to try to get it to slither off the trail but it did not move. It turns out it was dead. Someone has squashed the head flat, probably with one of those several rocks you see nearby, and sliced the rattle off with a knife.

 <h3>
  The back door to Black Diamond Mines regional park
 </h3>
 <br />
 We shortly arrived at the back entrance to the park, and stopped for a snack. The reason we didnt have lunch at this time is that someone forgot to bring the sandwiches. Fortunately we had lots of snacks and had a big dinner planned, perhaps somewhat earlier than previously anticipated.

 We filled up water at the visitor center and started the final 2 miles to the campsite.

 <h3>
  200 yards later: snake number 4
 </h3>
 <br />
 I didnt get a picture of snake number 3, and number 4 is one I did not identify yet. Presumably harmless but treated with utmost respect anyway.

 <h3>
  Pasta dinner
 </h3>
 <br />
 We cooked pasta, and made sauce from an onion, a head of garlic, a pound of ground beef that was frozen when we left in the morning, and a jar of tomato paste with some spices I had prepackaged.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, I brought a little cutting board. Whats another couple ounces when you have a 40 lb pack?
 <br />
 <br />
 <i>
  Yum

 The next morning we had oatmeal and the treat of a lemon soda that someone thoughtfully schlepped 7.6 miles in over hill and dale.

  Miner's trail

 <br />
 We went back out a different way than we came in. To the extent that you can, you should always make a point of doing this.

 Larissa met us at the parking lot and we were done. It was a great place to hike and we plan to return.
