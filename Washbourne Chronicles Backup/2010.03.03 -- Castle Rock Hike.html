 We enjoyed a lovely hike in March on the northwest flank of Mt Diablo when all the grass was lush and green, and it was not too hot. I wouldn't dream of trying this hike in June, when all the vegetation is crispy brown and the heat sucks the life right out of you.

 Here is a google satellite map of the location:

 You can tell by the long pants people are wearing that is not summer yet in California.

 There are only a couple months a year when everything is green like this, and it really is a joy to gain some elevation and have a look. Some younger people arent real fond of the elevation gain part, but they eventually realize that it is worth it.

 From here it is mostly flat back to the car. We ended up taking a route that I usually take on my bike and it turned out to be quite muddy, like up to your ankles. I emphatically did not win any congratulatory comments on the route back to the car, but in retrospect a good time was had by all.
