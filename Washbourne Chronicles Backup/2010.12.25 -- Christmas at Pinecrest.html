              </style>Three lovely days around Christmas in 2010 at Pinecrest and Dodge Ridge ski area near Yosemite.
<p>
 Believe it or not, this is a close as I (John) have ever been to Yosemite even though I have spent 15+ years in California (I plan to fix that in 2011).
</p>
<p>
 We enjoyed two perfect days of skiing and on the final night 6 inches of fresh powder was dumped for sledding enjoyment on the way back to the bay area.

 2010 was the year that Katerina learned to ski. I remembered to bring the "edgie wedgies" and that made all the difference (see the orange things between the skis on the picture below). We have another trip planned in February and I think she will be ready for the black diamond runs with her brothers.

 On the second day Katerina went to play in the snow for the later half of the day while the boys shredded the mountain. Mom and Katerina went to Pinescrest Lake and made snowmen.

 At the end of the day we all went to lake to appreciate the snowmen. It is a good thing we went when we did, because that night it dumped a ton of fresh powder and the snowmen were lost.

 We did not bring all the Christmas presents with us to Pinecrest, so the kids had some to open once we got home.

 We picked a great time to go: we did not wait more than 5 seconds in a lift line at any time, and there was zero traffic on the way home. Cant wait to go back in the summer!
