 Pinnacles National Monument -- November, 2009
</h3>
<br />
<h4>
 Friday
</h4>
<br />
This year the groups represented were: Akerberg, Clark, Hennenfent, Stefani, and Washbourne.
<br />
<br />
We had three adjacent sites on the camping loop, quite possibly the best sites at the campground. Everyone except Doug and Emily Clark showed up Friday night and had a lovely dinner of BBQ chicken, baked potatoes, beans with garlic, and lots of focacia; followed by desert of marshmallows.
<br />
<br />
<h4>
 Saturday
</h4>
<br />
Saturday we planned a big hike (purple on the map below): hitting all five of the top five things to see at Pinnacles, listed below in order of excellence.
<br />
<ol>
 <li>
  The high peaks trail (steep and narrow portion)
  <br />
  <br />
 </li>
 <li>
  Machete ridge on the back side (Chaparral)
  <br />
  <br />
 </li>
 <li>
  The Balconies caves
  <br />
  <br />
 </li>
 <li>
  The Bear gulch caves
  <br />
  <br />
 </li>
 <li>
  The Bear gulch reservoir
  <br />
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 Doug and Emily arrived Saturday morning, and we got underway at something like 9:25.  We left two cars at the Old Pinnacles trail head (see X on map below), then packed everyone back to the Bear Gulch Day Use Area and headed for the Bear Gulch caves (number 4 on the list).

 The next pictures are from the Bear Gulch caves.  Below is Gilles Hennenfent who is as yet un-encumbered by offspring.  Here is Peeter Akerberg who gets the trip hero award for carrying Sarah on his back the whole way.

 There were several narrow passages where Sarah needed special consideration.

 the Bear Gulch Reservoir (number 5 on the list). 10 years ago we would go climbing all day and then swim in the  reservoir, but swimming is not allowed any more.

 Another picture of the Reservoir from the rim trail on the way up to the high peaks. There were tons of people out that day, including maybe six million boy scouts.

 Robert and Jovanni hung out off the fron for most of the day. This early Erick is still up there with them.

 This is a favorite scrambling area at Scout Peak, or "the bench" as Joe calls it.

 These railing are proof we are on the high peaks trail. Check out the next couple pictures and see why the high peaks are number 1 on the list.

 This is the final approach to where we had lunch.

 Erick had no trouble going up this, but the next day when we were moving in the opposite direction he needed some help.

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 This descent was not as fun as usual because it was crowded: there were fifty thousand boy scouts running around.  We took the opportunity during a lull in scouts to go down this section. The following day, going the opposite direction, Erick was able to get up this by himself.

 The overhanging rock in many places forced Sarah to dismount.

 Last picture on the trail, maybe 1 1/2 miles from the cars. We hiked 8.5 miles  so major props to our youngest hiker Erick (5), and our most heavily burdened hiker Peeter.

 We had a raging fire both nights, and Saturday was really enjoyable because we  had everyone there.

 <h4>
  Sunday
 </h4>
 Sunday we planned a shorter hike (green on the map above), just a quick run up to the high peaks via Condor  Gulch and then back down to the Bear Gulch visitor area.
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 This is early on the start up Condor Gulch, and must be early in the morning because we are still wearing long sleeves. Doug got an A+ for arriving before 9:00 on Sunday, but he sort of cheated as he was right there in site #83.
