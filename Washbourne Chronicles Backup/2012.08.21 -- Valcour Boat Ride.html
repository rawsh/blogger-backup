              </style>We are getting close in time to the Valcour reunion pictures, but the week before my family and Mom and Dad had a day on the boat at Valcour island. We had originally planned to run south to Burlington from Peru dock and spend the day at a museum not far from a public pier. There was more weather than expected on the run south, and changed plans to spend the day in our old bay on the island.
<br />
<br />
The updated plan included a carry out lunch from Clare and Carl's Michigan Red Hots, located conveniently nearby, and some fishing.

 On the initial run south. The waves didnt appear large to me, but several folks in my immediate family -- who are not me, my Dad, or Mom -- do not have much time on boats so we changed plans.

 We returned to Peru dock and sent a runner to get michigans. This is a different runner.
