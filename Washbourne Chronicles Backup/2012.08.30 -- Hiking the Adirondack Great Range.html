              </style>Ever since we arrived for vacation at my parents home August 17, I had the bug to go for a froggy hike in the Adirondacks. We did not bring any of the backpacking gear, or I would have figured out a way to do a short trip. We also didnt bring any decent hiking boots, but decided to go for it anyway.
<br />
<br />
Before college, when I lived out east, I did some hiking and backpacking in the Adirondacks, but I was not nearly as into it as I have been recently. So I decided to go fairly big.
<br />
<br />
<h3>
 Going big
</h3>
<p>
 After some research online, I decided to hike Gothics, the tenth highest Adirondack peak, with a couple more of the 46ers -- peaks over 4000 feet -- thrown in. After further research I found out we could add two more of the 46ers if we did two more 1/2 mile sidetracks one way. We were looking at a dead minimum of 14.5 miles without the side trips, so it was looking to be a pretty epic day.
 <br />
 <br />
 I decided to go in at the Keene Valley entrance, known as the Garden, and do an all day trip.

 <h3>
  The itinerary, in trail order
 </h3>
</p>
<p>
 So here is the intended itinerary. I wisely concluded that we would not be able to do the second optional side hike to Lower Wolf Jaw, but that turns out to be fine because there is no individual 46er patch for the wolf jaws individually.
 <ul>
  <li>
   Saddleback (4515)
  </li>
  <li>
   Gothics (4726)
  </li>
  <li>
   Armstrong (4419)
  </li>
  <li>
   Upper Wolf Jar (4185)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br />
 <br />
 <h3>
  The Garden to John's Brooke Lodge
 </h3>
</p>
<p>
 We got the Garden around 7:30 and started the hike.

 This next stretch was one of the dicey bits of the trail, as far as staying on the right track. Most of the trails were quite well marked and easy to follow, but this bit needs a little help from the trail crew.

  Decision piont for Saddleback

 We arrived at the the trail junction for Gothics, where we had to make a call on adding the 1 mile to bag Saddleback.

  Lunch on Saddleback mountain
 </h3>
</p>
<p>
 We decided to add Saddleback with the optional hiking. It turned out to be fairly steep, but nothing like Gothics which was waiting ahead.
 <br />
 <br />
 <i>
  Panoramic view from close to Saddleback. The mountain with the scars in the foreground is Basin, with Haystack just peaking over the shoulder. Upper Ausable lake in the distance, which apparently and unfortunately is not available as a camping spot for a backpacking trip.

  At mile 14, still smiling! Maybe because we just refilled the water bottles with the MSR filter at Wolfjaw brook. I like mechanical filters because you can drink right away and enjoy clear, cold, clean water without any wacky taste ruination.

  We chose an unfortunate route back, the south trail along John's Brook, and had to do quite a bit of bushwhacking and some of the route along the boulders of John's brook.

</p>
<p>
 We even had advice from a well experienced local (Thanks Anne!) who told us not to take the southside trail, but it looked so good on the map ...

 <h3>
  Summary
 </h3>
</p>
<p>
 What a great trip! We spent about 10.5 hours on the trail covering 17.5 miles and 6000 feet of delta Z. We bagged 4 of the Adirondack 46ers and really enjoyed the day. If we could change one thing, we agreed we would have loved to have had our real hiking boots from back in California. Next time ...
 <br />
 <br />
 I treated Robert and myself to some Adirondack peak patches from the Mountaineer outfitter in Keene.
