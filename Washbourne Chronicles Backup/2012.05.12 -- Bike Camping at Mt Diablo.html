              </style>This is a quick report of a good idea with very poor logistical planning. The boys and I wanted to do something one weekend in may, and there was Mt Diablo in the distance. So I had the idea of riding our bikes up the mountain and bringing enough gear to spend the night. We planned to go to Juniper Camp, which is quite close to the top of the mountain.

<h3>
 Good idea, poor planning
</h3>
<br />
Right away, after looking at the picture below, you can get an idea of what I mean by poor planning. Instead of towing a trailer with the gear in it -- which we could have easily done -- I decided to load up a backpack and strap it on the hitch for the trail-a-bike that Erick would ride. Big mistake, capital M.

 Larissa dropped us off at the north entrance to Mt Diablo, and then drove away before I really tried out the stability of the configuration. The first time we tried to ride, we fell over sideways, to the vast amusement of a gaggle of observers assembling to ride up the mountain.

  The bike and gear configuration turned out to be not very stable

  Interlude, partway up the mountain

 <br />
 So here I am, maybe halfway up, pretty much ready to die. The constant strain of keeping the bike from tipping over at the slightest bit of lateral movement was really cutting into my enjoyment of the day.

  At 2000 ft, just below the junction of the north and south roads up the mountain. You can really appreciate the fine details of balancing the bike and trail-a-bike and gear combo in this picture.

 <h3>
  Juniper camp

 <br />
 After a significant break or seventeen, we did eventually make it to Juniper camp.

 After getting rinsed off, we took a walk around Juniper. The original plan was to do a night hike up to the summit, but that got unamimously vetoed by all participants. We all think another run would be nice, but this time with the bike trailer instead of a hillbilly contraption.
