              </style>Our trip to Tahoe in January was great, here are some pics from a day we spent at the Spooner Lake cross country ski area. Everyone had a great time and the boys liked XC skiing as much or more than downhill, which is great considering both how good for you it is and how economical.

 Erick did super well on his own.

 There was plenty of snow but the temperature was pretty mild. A perfect day! Everyone just got bundled up and we enjoyed the snow and the solitude on the trails.
