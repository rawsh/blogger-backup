 Epic snow in Lake Tahoe!
</h2>
<p>
 We have historically had very good luck on timing our ski trips to lake Tahoe. This year the snow was
 <b>
  EPIC
 </b>
 . The official reports say they had 10 feet the week we were there, and 3 feet over our first two days. We went up on Wednesday afternoon during the storm and had almost two hours of driving with chains. We had one chain break and were delayed getting a replacement, but arrived at the apartment around 8:00 p.m.
</p>
<p>
 The next day the snow was still falling pretty strongly, but this was Katerina's chance to really hit the slopes. She skied in Pinecrest last year, but this year she really figured it out.

 Robert borrowed a snowboard from a friend and took a lesson on Thursday morning. I think he enjoyed it but he is more comfortable on skis.

 In the afternoon all of us were together.

 Thursday night another foot of snow fell, and the powder was wicked fluffy and wonderful. Friday was a perfect ski day: lots of fresh snow and the sun came out.
 <br />

 After Katerina took a rest, Robert and Erick and I went to the top of the mountain. The skiing was the best I ever experienced. In the trees there were feet of fresh fluffy powder.

  Cross country skiing at Spooner Lake
 </h2>
 On Saturday we went to Spooner Lake for cross country skiing. This turned out to be a great idea because it was President's day weekend and nine million people I didnt want to see went to the downhill ski areas.
</p>
<p>
 The snow and conditions at Spooner Lake were outstanding. The sky was clear blue, the snow was pure white and thick and fluffy, and everyone was in a great mood. It was a really enjoyable day.

 After a nice lunch in the lodge, our friends hit the road to go back to the bay area and we went back out for another couple hours. We decided to try out Katerina on cross country skis.
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />

  Version 2: Katerina hanging on to my poles. This worked sort of but not really,  and is hell on your back.

 <br />

 <br />

</p>
<p>
 So then we needed poles, and I skied back up to the lodge to get them, with the only requirement that they were:
 <br />
 <br />
 <i>

  with

</p>
<p>
 This was OK, but progress was not fast. She shuffled along for 45 minutes on her own. Everyone else took off and disappeared, and as I was patiently waiting for Katerina, I was hitting my poles on the boughs that were loaded with snow. This looked fun to Katerina so she had to do it.

  I managed to get someone else to pull the sled,  but only while it was empty of Katerina.

 We headed back to the lodge and made the drive back to the bay area with no traffic and no chains. Overall a splendid trip!
