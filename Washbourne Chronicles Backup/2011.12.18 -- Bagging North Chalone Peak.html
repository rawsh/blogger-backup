              </style>On the November Pinnacles camping trip I got the bug in my head to hike out to North Chalone Peak. In all of our trips to Pinnacles National Monument we have never taken that route, and it is the highest point in the surrounding area. On the last day of the camping trip Robert and Erick and I went part of the way out but did not have time to do the whole thing, and I felt like we had to return to bag North Chalone Peak.

  We got up pretty early on Sunday and headed south. Or southeast in this picture.

 Roughly two hours drive and you are at Pinnacles. What a great place! I always feel bad that it costs so little to visit, and I didnt have exact change to pay the paltry five dollar fee so I left a ten instead.

  You really cannot visit Pinnacles with kids without going through some caves.

 We had lunch on North Chalone Peak and enjoyed the beautiful weather and then headed back. A little over 4 miles one way.

 We made it home by 4:00 pm and really enoyed this trip. Put it on your list of what to do.
