              </style>First off: thanks to everyone who contributed to our Tour de Cure fundraising! We raised $3,300 for the American Diabetes Association. My best year yet, so thank you very much for your generosity.
<br />
<br />
The day of the ride this year the weather was perfect! No rain or mud, just sun and happy people. Robert and I started the 25 mile route, and then Larissa met us with 15 miles to go and we attached the rest of the long bike for Erick and Katerina.
<br />
<br />
Everyone had a good time and we had lots of comments about the long bike. A steady wall of cheering greeted us as we finished the final uphill to the finish line. Without a doubt we had the longest bike at the event this year.
<br />
<br />
Next year Robert and I may do 50, and then pick up the other two with 20 or 25 miles to go.

 Again, thanks you very much for your generosity! You rock!
