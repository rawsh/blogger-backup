This was a great trip! Looking back through the pictures I realized how much we enjoyed the beautiful views of the Ohlone Wilderness. This is Robert and my second and Erick's first trip from Lake Del Valle near Livermore to the Sunol park headquarters 25 miles east. The trip consists of a challening but short first day of less than 3 miles, an epic second day in 9 miles of very rugged terrain, and a long but beautiful downward hike out on the last day of around 11 miles.

 Day 1: hiking to Boyd's Camp
</h2>
We left the car at the Lichen Bark day use area and started the slog up the quite steep first part of the trail. It really starts out with a bang.
<br />
<br />
<i>
 The "campground" on the map is not Boyd's camp but the Lake Del Valle family camp ground.

 Heading towards the wrong (low) part of Williams Gulch. Watching all that elevation disappear is really a sinking feeling ...

 The climb gets much easier and you start to get a breeze from the ridge.

<br />

 Erick with lots of energy. So much energy that I convinced him to go back for the camera that I left in my pack ...

<br />

 Weird things hanging in trees. Not sure what these are, but maybe some botanist can help me out.

<br />
<br />

 This bit of trail slopes in the right direction, but you can almost hear the whining coming from a few pictures down ...

<br />
<br />

 My dad would blow this up and convince you it is a red tailed hawk or a condor or a yellow bellied sap-sucker.

 Here is where the whining came from. Yes we have to go all the way down and then right back up. No other way to go.

 Almost to the Sunol backpack camp, and that is a good thing because we were quite low on water. "Quite low" is actually code for totally out and thirsty as hell.

 This is like a false flat on a bike ride: almost done but you still have 2.3 miles to go.

<br />

 We made a poor decision and opted for the road instead of staying on the trail, but it seemed like a good decision at the time. That gravel road was endless drudgery.
</i>
<br />
<br />

 You would not believe what Erick carried in his pack.
</i>
<br />
<br />
<img src="./images/2012.02.05 -- Ohlone Wilderness/54..Ohlone.JPG" />
<br />
<br />
After the sag wagon came to pick us up we retrieved the car and went to weigh the rocks Erick carried. I make it 6 or 7 pounds.
